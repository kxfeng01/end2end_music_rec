# ðŸŽµ Real-time Music Recommendation System

Welcome to our repository, where we introduce an advanced **Real-time Music Recommendation System**. This system leverages cutting-edge technology including **Apache Kafka, Spark ALS (Alternating Least Squares), FastAPI, and Streamlit** to deliver personalized music recommendations based on user interactions. The entire setup is designed to be scalable and is containerized using Docker, ensuring it is ready for cloud deployment.

## ðŸš€ Key Features

- **Real-Time User Interactions**: Utilizes Apache Kafka for robust streaming data ingestion, capturing user interactions as they happen.
- **Dynamic Model Retraining**: Incorporates Spark ALS to update the recommendation model dynamically, ensuring recommendations are based on the most current data.
- **RESTful API**: Built with FastAPI, this API is designed to deliver fast and efficient song recommendations.
- **Interactive User Interface**: Streamlit is used to create a responsive and interactive web app for end-users.
- **Scalable Deployment**: The entire system is Dockerized, allowing for easy deployment and scalability in cloud environments.
